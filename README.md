# Credit Risk Modeling and Data Science in Fintech
This project offers a comprehensive work on building state-of-the-art credit scoring models tailored specifically for financial lending in the Fintech industry.

# Situation:
Project focused on credit risk modeling and understanding the role of data science in the lending industry.

# Task:
During the project, my main tasks were threefold:

- **Understanding the Role of Data Science in Lending:** My goal was to grasp the pivotal role data science plays in the Fintech sector, particularly in credit risk assessment. I sought insights into the various ways data scientists contribute to the decision-making process, enhancing my understanding of the industry's landscape.

- **Building Real-World Credit Risk Models:** I delved into building state-of-the-art credit risk models. This hands-on experience allowed me to implement the concepts learned in a real-world context, improving my ability to create accurate and effective models.

- **Appreciating Real-World Challenges:** I gained valuable knowledge about the challenges faced by data scientists working in Fintech. I explored the intricacies of model explainability, interpretability, and the common hurdles of model drift and decay. This aspect of the project broadened my perspectives and equipped me with strategies to overcome such challenges.

# Action:
I participated in interactive discussions, collaborated with available resources, and completed hands-on exercises to build and fine-tune credit risk models. I sought to implement best practices, understand model performance metrics, and leverage different techniques to enhance the models' explainability and interpretability.

# Result:
The project resulted in a comprehensive understanding of data science's pivotal role in the Fintech domain and its significance in credit risk modeling. The hands-on experience allowed me to strengthen my practical skills, enabling me to build more relevant and accurate credit risk models. Moreover, I gained insights into the real-world challenges faced by data scientists in the lending industry, empowering me to address issues related to model explainability, interpretability, drift, and decay effectively.

# Key Takeaways:
The project allowed me to:

- Gain insights into the crucial role data science plays in Fintech and credit risk assessment.
- Acquire practical skills and hands-on experience in building state-of-the-art credit risk models.
- Appreciate the challenges data scientists encounter and learn how to tackle model explainability, interpretability, drift, and decay.
- Overall, the project provided a transformative learning experience that equipped me with the necessary tools and knowledge to excel as a data scientist in the Fintech industry, contributing to more informed and data-driven decisions in the world of lending.

# Data:
Here we used the Home Credit Default Risk dataset which you can find it on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-credit-default-risk

All the data are distributed in several different csv files, where the parent of all of these is application_{train|test}.csv.
